# Model Structure

## Overview

PAGE-2020 is constructed to reproduce the PAGE-ICE model structure, which features ten time periods and eight world regions. These time periods and regions are listed below. Climate change impacts for four sectors are calculated in addition to the costs of mitigation-- herein referred to as abatement policies-- and the costs of adaptation. Both impacts and costs can be computed under parameter uncertainty.

This iteration of PAGE subsets the model into 33 components, elaborated under the "Components" section below, and two basic parts: climate and economy. There are also a number of components particular to PAGE-2020 which assist with certain functionalities. Within the climate model, gases and sulphates are split into three components each-- namely the "Cycle", "Emissions", and "Forcing" components for that gas. Forcings are then aggregated into "Total Forcing" and feed into "Climate Temperature". The economic model includes "Abatement Costs", "Adaptation Costs", and "Discontinuous" impacts as well as impacts from "Sea Level Rise", "Market Damages", and "Non-Market Damages". It also features an "Equity Weighting" component.

A schematic of the model, and full listing of components, follows below.

## Time periods and regions

The ten uneven timesteps employed in PAGE-2020 are 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100, 2150, 2200, 2250, and 2300. The baseline period used, prior to any modeled results, is 2015.

The eight regions included are Europe (EU), the United States (US or USA), other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OT or OECD), the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the rest of Europe (EE or USSR), China and centrally planned Asia (CA or China), India and Southeast Asia (IA or SEAsia), Africa and the Middle East (AF or Africa), and Latin America (LA or LatAmerica).  These parenthetical labels are used throughout the data files and in the model specification.  PAGE-2020, like PAGE-ICE, employs the EU as a baseline region, with some processes calculated relative to their EU values.

## Scenarios

PAGE-2020 uses the RCP-SSP scenario scheme used by the IPCC, along
with additional scenarios for studying a 1.5 C mitigation pathway and
mitigation that corresponds to the existing INDC commitments. These
scenarios combine both emissions and socioeconomic growth. The
available scenarios are: `Zero Emissions & SSP1`, `1.5 degC Target`,
`2 degC Target`, `2.5 degC Target`, `NDCs`, `NDCs Partial`, `BAU`,
`RCP1.9 & SSP1`, `RCP2.6 & SSP1`, `RCP4.5 & SSP2`, and `RCP8.5 & SSP5`.
These are described in more detail in
[Yumashev et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09863-x#Sec14).

## Sectors and gases

The model is divided into four impact sectors: sea level rise, market damages (called "economic damages" in PAGE-ICE), non-market damages (called "non-economic" in PAGE-ICE), and discontinuities. The six greenhouse gases of the Kyoto Protocol are each included via components that respectively model CO2, CH4, N2O, and a subset of low-concentration gases collectively termed "linear gases." Linear gases include HFCs, PFCs, and SF6. Sulphate forcing is also modelled.

The four impact sectors in PAGE-2020 are modelled independently and reflect damages as a proportion of GDP. Sea level rise is a lagged linear function of global mean temperature. The market damages are  based on Burke et al. (2015). Discontinuity, or the risk of climate change triggering large-scale damages, reflects a variety of different possible types of disaster.

### Model interface scripts

The following scripts provide a basic function interface to the PAGE model:
- main_model.jl: provides the `getpage` function, to get an
  initialised PAGE model.
- climate_model.jl: provides the `climatemodel` function, to get only the
  PAGE model.
- mcs.jl: provides the `do_monte_carlo_runs` function, to the model in
  Monte Carlo mode.
- compute_scc.jl: provides the `compute_scc_mcs` function to get a
  series of SCC Monte Carlo draws.

### Functional Components of PAGE-2020

The following scripts assist in the actual running of PAGE-2020, and are further elaborated in the technical user guide.

- load_parameters.jl
- save_parameters.jl
- mctools.jl
